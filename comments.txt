For the exam we use files exported from solidworks. 
Note: check the folder Auxiliars. 

Procedure:
                              Calculations of the motors
 
To calculate  the max velocity we take from the datasheet the value of 240 RPM that belong of the 6 volts motor, 
and we convert it on rad/s, as shown below: 

    240 RPM to rad/s

    2pi
   ----- (240 RPM) = 25.132741199999998 rad/s
    60

To calculate  the max Torque we take from the datasheet the value of 5500 mg*cm that belong of the 6 volts motor, 
and we convert it on Nm, as shown below:

   5500mg*cm to Nm

    1 g*cm = 0.0000980665 Nm

    (5.5 g*cm)(0.0000980665 Nm)
   ------------------- =   0.00053936575 Nm
             1 g*cm


                                          Encoder 

The encoder has 20 clicks so that means that 20 clicks is equal to 360 degrees. 

                     2pi
      Resolution =  -----  = 0.3141592654 
                     20


                                        lookuptable

  I take from the datasheet the value of 0.3 cm of resolution, and do the shown belog: 

     0       0    0                     500 cm - 2 cm                
    0.2      0    0                    -----------------   = 1660
     5      1660  0                         0.3 cm 


  The range of operation is from 2 cm  to 500 cm. 


////////////////////////////////////////////////
for the code

We create 2 diferent .h one is for calculate the velocity of the robot and the second one is for to obatain the distance of the distance sensor,
then we use 2 states for this project (manual and autonomous), and we created the funtions for all the movements.

line 106 to 124: we create the the conditions for turn right and left depending on which sensor sens the obstacule.

line 128 to 150: we put the funtion for webots devices.
